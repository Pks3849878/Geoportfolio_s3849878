		A key part of this class was completing a semester-long project focussing on creating a three-tier architecture system within a GIS framework to develop an 
		interactive mapping application for visualizing drought risk across Australia using open-source data.
		Key components of the project included: 

		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li><b>Backend:</b> Used PostGIS as a spatial database to store and manage large raster datasets and shapefile LGA DRI datasets. </li>
			<li><b>Middleware:</b> Implemented GeoServer to facilitate interoperability between the backend and frontend, using OGC standards like WMS and WFS.</li>
			<li><b>Frontend:</b> Initially planned to use QGIS2Web and GitHub for hosting, but due to data size limitations, CARTO was used as an alternative to create an interactive web-based map. </li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->
		<p>
			QGIS was utilized for data preprocessing and analysis, and included the use of plugins such as PostGIS Raster Import. In order to visualize the map, I created a drought risk 
			assessment map featuring multiple layers (DRI, VHI, SMI, SPI) visualized through Australia's LGAs, with interactive widgets for user engagement. The visualisation included 
			appropriately colouring the thematic index layers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The project demonstrated the potential of open-source GIS tools and cloud-based technologies for creating functional and interactive environmental monitoring applications, while also highlighting challenges in data interoperability and hosting large datasets.

	<div class="paragraphs">
		This semester long project involved designing and implementing a sophisticated three-tier geospatial data processing and visualization system using cloud-based architecture. Ultimately, this was the conceptual framework created. Deployed on Azure virtual machine, the system integrates various technologies across backend, middleware, and frontend tiers. The backend utilizes PostGIS for spatial data storage and QGIS for data preprocessing, generating critical indices like the Drought Risk Index. The middleware employs GeoServer and its REST API for data serving, while the frontend presents the processed data through a web application accessible via standard web browsers. This architecture showcases my skills in database management, geospatial analysis, web services, and full-stack development, highlighting my ability to create comprehensive solutions for complex geospatial challenges.

		This interactive map showcases my skills in cloud-based, open-source GIS solutions by visualizing the Drought Risk Index (DRI) across Australia's Local Government Areas. Utilizing data from the Bureau of Meteorology, the map integrates multiple indices including Vegetation Health, Soil Moisture, and Standardized Precipitation to provide a comprehensive view of drought susceptibility. Feel free to explore the various layers to gain insights into how drought risk varies across the continent, with particular attention to the higher risk areas in Central and Western Australia, highlighting the vulnerability of remote communities.

	<div class="bar"><h2>Spatial Information Science Analytics</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		In the Spatial Information Science Analytics class, I undertook a comprehensive GIS project to identify optimal locations for apple tree cultivation in Victoria, Australia. 
		This project allowed me to apply advanced GIS technologies and operations to a real-world agricultural challenge. 
		<p>
		<b>Project components:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Utilized ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro for data manipulation and analysis</li>
			<li>Created interpolated maps for rainfall and elevation using Universal Kriging methods</li>
			<li>Developed raster layers for factors including slope, aspect, water proximity, and soil pH</li>
			<li>Performed raster analysis and reclassification</li>
			<li>Conducted a weighted sum analysis for multi-criteria decision making</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Technical Skills Applied:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Geostatistical analysis</li>
			<li>Raster manipulation</li>
			<li>Multi-criteria suitability analysis</li>
			<li>Map design and layout creation</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Results and Outputs:</b> 
		<ul>
			1.	Interpolated rainfall map of Victoria
			<p></p>
			2.	Interpolated elevation map of Victoria
			<p></p>
			3.	Final multivariate suitability map for apple tree agriculture
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The project revealed that ideal conditions for apple tree growing were lower elevation, lower slope, higher rainfall, northern or southern aspect, proximity to water 
			sources, and soil pH between 5.8 and 7. The findings were validated against existing orchard locations, demonstrating the practical applicability of the analysis.
			This project not only enhanced my GIS skills but also contributed valuable insights into optimal agricultural land use in Victoria, potentially informing future 
			orchard planning and development strategies.

	<img src="Academic-Gallery/average_rain.JPG" width="auto" height="700px" class="image"> <!-- #ID# #PICTURE# Change to a picture of YOUR assignment images -->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		This map demonstrates my proficiency in spatial analysis and data visualization using ArcMap 10.8.2. I created a map showcasing the spatial variation of mean annual rainfall across Victoria, Australia, using data from 360 weather stations. The analysis employed Universal Kriging interpolation to generate a continuous rainfall surface from point data. The resulting map effectively illustrates the rainfall gradient across the state, with higher precipitation in the eastern regions (represented in green) and drier conditions in the northwest (shown in red).

		This map showcases my expertise in handling large datasets and applying advanced spatial interpolation techniques. I created a detailed elevation map of Victoria, Australia, utilizing 35,347 elevation readings sourced from VicDatashare. The analysis employed Universal Kriging interpolation to generate a continuous elevation surface from point data. The resulting map effectively illustrates the topographic variation across Victoria, with lower elevations (green) dominating the west and north, and higher elevations (red) concentrated in the eastern regions, clearly depicting the Victorian High Country.
